With the increase in art forms and appreciation, we find ourselves amongst many of those who seek travelling to such places of myriad art and culture.While this real life situation is common and relatable, one who would always look puzzled in decided on such art places.\n\nThrough this project, I hope to go through the world cities and pick out the art venues located in different cities.Cluster these palces and indicate the most preferrable art places to visit.One might find this information analysis handy while considering their next Destination that spells Art.\n\n<p><b>Problem/Analytic Approach:</b></p>\n\nSince the question is to find various cities that have art aspects in them, the problem deals with identifying the art aspects in the world and grouping them based on their geographical location into actual cities that they belong.
